# DigiQueue
In India, millions waste hours every day standing in long queues at clinics, temples, salons, ration shops, 
and government offices — often in harsh weather, with no idea when their turn will come.

This outdated system leads to lost income for workers, physical strain for the elderly and sick, and 
frustration for everyone involved. Despite India’s digital progress most local establishments still manage  queues manually due to lack of simple, scalable solutions.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION 
 DigiQueue
is a real-time smart queuing system that lets people book tokens remotely 
and track their turn from anywhere. 
It empowers clinics, temples, salons, and ration shops to manage queues digitally 
without any hardware or hassle.
Users get timely alerts, while admins can control crowd flow with just a tap.  It’s fast, 
simple, and built to bring dignity, order, and saved time to everyday lives across India
